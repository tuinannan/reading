Title: Nested Enclave: Supporting Fine-grained Hierarchical Isolation with SGX
Coference: ISCA 2020

Intel SGX is  promising technology which provides strong calculation and 
memory isolation between processes and between the security-sentive part
and security-insensitive part of a process. SGX reserves a virtual address
region as the enclave address, data and code inside this region will be
mapped to a specific physical memory region, the data privacy and integrity
of which are protected by hardware. However, SGX only provides one level
of security: the data and code inside an enclave are secure, and the outside
world is insecure. However, real-life applications sometimes need multiple-
level security: if the SGX user is hosting a web application on a server,
to secure the web user's execution, the host will generate one enclave for
each user. However, all these enclaves need to use standard library which 
also need to be secured but may consist of security vulnerablities. With 
the native SGX design, we will have to generate another enclave for the 
library and the commucation between the web user enclave and the library
can be secured by standard cryptographic algorithms. 

The insight of this paper is that the communication between enclaves are
very expensive as the CPU needs to first leave the enclave mode, and
then re-enter the enclave mode, adding contect switch latency to the 
critical path. To solve this problem, this paper propose "nest enclave",
in which an enclave can be an inner enclave of another enclave, to provide
multiple-level security in SGX. Nested enclave only requries littel changes
on the access control policy of SGX: previouly no other enclave is allowed
to access data in an enclave; however, with nested enclave, inner enclaves
are able to access data in their outer enclaves.
