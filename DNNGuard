Title: DNNGuard: An Elastic Hetergeneous DNN Accelerator Architecture against Adversarial Attacks
Conference: ASPLOS'20
Adversarial attacks have been one of the main security concerns of DNN models.
Adversarial attacks slightly modify the input data to a DNN model in a certain way so that the
inference result will not totally wrong. Researchers have been proposing defense
mechanisms against adversarial attacks. For example, Feature Squeezing detects
adversary examples by median smoothing filter and a data bit width compression.
In general, in the defense, before an input is fed into the network model, it
needs to be checked first by a "detector" for filtering out adversarial inputs.

Currently, domain specific hardware accelerators are widely used for DNN models.
However, the defending of adversarial attacks were not considered in the design
of those accelerators. Simply running the detection network in those
accelerators may cause significant performance overhead. Additionally, using a
separate accerlator just for the detection network may cause security issues as
the communication (data transfer) in between the two accelerators are not
protected. Thus, it is necessary to propose a new DNN accelerator with
considering the existence of the detection network.

This work made a key insight that the most important requirements of
the detection-aware accelerator are as follows:
1) High-bandwidth data sharing between the target network and the detection
network.
2) The elasticity of assigning hardware resource to the detection network.
3) The need of CPU as some of the calculations run more efficiently on the CPU.

Based on this insight, this work proposed a new DNN accelerator namde DNNGuard.
